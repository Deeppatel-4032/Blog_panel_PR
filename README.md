# Blog Post Panel

## Overview
This project is a **Blog Post Panel** where users can register and log in to create, read, edit, and delete their blogs. Users can also view blog posts created by other users, but only the author of a blog post has the ability to modify or delete their own content.

### Key Features:
1. **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and manage their sessions.
2. **Blog Management**: Users can create, view, edit, and delete their blogs.
3. **View Blogs**: All users can view blog posts made by others, but they can't edit or delete them.
4. **Image Uploads**: Users can upload images for their blogs using Multer.

## Project Stack

- **Frontend (UI)**: EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
- **Backend**: Express.js (Node.js Framework)
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
- **Authentication**: Passport.js (Local strategy for user authentication)
- **File Uploads**: Multer (For handling image uploads)

## Features

### User Authentication:
- **Register**: Users can create an account by providing a username, email, and password.
- **Login**: Users can log in using the credentials created during registration.
- **Session Management**: Users are kept logged in using cookies and sessions. Session handling is done using Express sessions, and user authentication is managed by Passport.js.

### Blog Management:
- **Add Blog**: Users can create a new blog post by providing a title, content, and an optional image (uploaded via Multer).
- **Edit Blog**: Logged-in users can edit the title, content, and image of their own blog posts.
- **Delete Blog**: Users have the option to delete their own blog posts.

### View Blogs:
- **All Blogs Page**: A public page where users can view all blogs created by other users. No editing or deletion is allowed on this page.
- **My Blogs Page**: A personal page where logged-in users can view, edit, or delete only their own blogs.
